  :title: Defend Title IX Guidelines for Campus Sexual Assault
  :description: |-
    In mid-July, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced that she is considering changes to how the Department of Education enforces Title IX ("9") with respect to campus sexual assault, specifically the 2011 guidelines for how colleges and universities respond to allegations of sexual violence between students on and off campus.These guidelines, outlined in a Dear Colleague Letter (DCL), defines schools’ responsibilities in building a safe and responsive campus, clarifies the requirement that schools must independently investigate reports of sexual violence between students (regardless of the existence of a criminal investigation), and defines “preponderance of the evidence” as the burden of proof necessary when adjudicating sexual assault cases on campus.

    Since 2011, many universities have overhauled their programs for reporting and investigating sexual assault, educating campuses on sex discrimination and providing support for victims of sexual violence. A rushed roll-back of these rules by the administration would send a terrible message to students and administrators and would undermine the protections universities, students and activists have worked so hard to implement.

    Underlining concerns that this administration is ill-equipped to handle sexual assault policy, Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Department's Civil Rights Division Candice Jackson stated to the New York Times that 90% of sexual assault accusations “fall into the category of ‘we were both drunk,’ ‘we broke up.” While Asst. Secretary Jackson has apologized for these remarks, they indicate a department that does not take sexual assault seriously, and call into question her ability to fairly evaluate and manage the Department’s policies around this sensitive and critical issue.

    Twenty state Attorney Generals have already written to Secretary DeVos strongly opposing any roll-back of the Title IX protections and expressing concerns about the continuing role of Assistant Secretary Jackson. These AG's were from: CA, CT, DE, DC, HI, IL, IA, KY, ME, MD, MA, MN, NM, NY, NC, OR, PA, RI, VT, VA.

    Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m an American from [CITY, STATE].

    [IF DEPT of ED] I’m calling to urge Secretary DeVos to maintain the critical Title IX protections for survivors of campus sexual assault as guided by the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter. This is a serious and troubling epidemic, and it is vital that schools maintain strong policy guidelines to protect its vulnerable students.

    [IF CALLING FROM  CA, CT, DE, DC, HI, IL, IA, KY, ME, MD, MA, MN, NM, NY, NC, OR, PA, RI, VT, VA] I'm calling to thank the Attorney General for signing the letter opposing any rollback of Title 9 college campus sexual assault protections by the Department of Education, and I encourage the Attorney General to keep fighting against this serious and troubling epidemic.

    [ALL OTHER STATES] I'm calling to urge [AG NAME] to join with other state Attorneys General in opposing any rollback of the Title 9 college campus sexual assault protections by the Department of Education. This is a serious and troubling epidemic, and it is vital that schools maintain strong policy guidelines to protect its vulnerable students.

    Thank you for your time and attention.

  :title: Defend University Affirmative Action Admissions Policy
  :description: "On August 1st, the New York Times revealed details of an internal
    Department of Justice document they obtained that describes plans by the Civil
    Rights Division to crack down on university 'affirmative action' policies. In
    the document, the department is seeking lawyers to investigate and potentially
    sue universities for discriminating against white applicants (\"intentional race-based
    discrimination\") in their admissions processes. Typically, the Educational Opportunities
    Section of the DoJ handles university matters, but due to reported unwillingness
    by these career civil servants/education experts to reverse course on civil rights,
    the political appointee staffed Civil Rights Division will handle this project.\n\nThis
    new affirmative action project falls in line with other actions taken by Jeff
    Sessions and the DoJ that attack civil rights and equal opportunity for minority
    American populations. The continuing systemic racial discrimination and oppression
    in our society often makes it harder for young people of color to obtain the same
    educational resources as their white counterparts. Affirmative action admissions
    programs allow students from these disadvantaged backgrounds more balanced access
    to higher education. The Supreme Court has also ruled that a diverse student body
    has its own educational benefits, allowing universities to use race as an admission
    factor.    \n\nWhile many white students have criticized and waged lawsuits against
    affirmative action, claiming unfair rejections in favor of \"less qualified\"
    students, the statistics simply don't line up. In fact, white women are the primary
    beneficiaries of affirmative action policies. University 'legacy' policies also
    grant admission to students from predominantly white families, regardless of their
    performance level. A glaring example of this practice is Jared Kushner’s acceptance
    into Harvard to the surprise of many of his teachers who thought he was not qualified.
    (His father also donated $2.5M to the school.) "
  :template: |-
    Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

    I'm calling to express my serious disapproval of the Department's plans to investigate and sue universities because of their affirmative action admissions policy. This is clearly another attempt by this Department to deny equal opportunity to minority Americans in order to perpetuate white privilege, and I demand this project be shut down immediately.

    Thank you for your time and attention.

  :title: Preserve Federal Civil Rights Protections for Transgender People
  :description: "Nine Republican House Representatives are currently sponsoring HR
    2796, the Civil Rights Uniformity Act. This hateful bill would exclude transgender
    people from federal civil rights protections against gender discrimination. The
    bill specifically bans gender identity from being \"treated as a protected class
    in Federal law or policy\" without congressional approval, meaning that only Congress
    would be able to pass laws protecting trans rights. \n\nWhile this bill is likely
    just a political stunt that will never make it out of committee, its consequences
    could still be deadly. There is an established correlation between passage of
    bigoted policies like this one and increased rates of suicide in the transgender
    community. Hate-based law making fuels anti-trans attitudes at the highest levels
    of our government and sends a message to trans people that their rights and their
    lives are unimportant. Transgender people face significant discrimination and
    violence because of their gender identity, with over a quarter of trans people
    reporting being fired because of bias and half reporting harassment at work. Trans
    people of color also face even higher rates of discrimination than white transgender
    people. \n\nEroding transgender people's rights at a federal level would endanger
    both their financial and psychological well-being. This latest assault on transgender
    people is despicable and unacceptable. We must make it abundantly clear that Americans
    will not tolerate these blatant attacks on transgender people's civil rights. "
  :template: "Hi, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].   \n\n[IF
    COMMITTEE]: I'd like to pass along a message for the Chairman and committee members.
    I ask that the committee not take any action on HR 2796, the Civil Rights Uniformity
    Act. This bill is an unacceptable, bigoted attack on transgender people and their
    rights.\n\n[IF REP]: I am calling to express my strongest opposition to HR 2796,
    the Civil Rights Uniformity Act, a bigoted attack on transgender people. I ask
    that [REP/SEN NAME] vocally denounce HR 2796 as an unacceptable assault on transgender

  :title: Stop Trump from Sabotaging the ACA
  :description: "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's plan to repeal the ACA (the
    \"Skinny Repeal\") failed on the Senate floor, 49-51, on July 27th. While he called
    the downfall of his ongoing efforts to dismantle the ACA \"disappointing\" and
    stated that it was time to \"move on.\" McConnell continued to denounce the ACA
    and its effectiveness, repeating myths of its instability. The Congressional Republicans'
    ability to repeal the ACA may be over, but now the threat of Republican sabotage
    of the law by undermining its enforcement is still a real possibility. Indeed,
    Trump has called on Republicans to  \"let Obamacare fail, it will be a lot easier,\"
    stating, \"We're not going to own it. I'm not going to own it.\" \n\nAnalyses
    of the ACA have repeatedly shown that the individual markets are largely functioning
    well, with cost-sharing subsidies shielding buyers from premium cost increases.
    However, Trump and the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Tom Price,
    are taking steps to destabilize these markets. Trump is threatening to withhold
    insurance payments known as cost-sharing reductions (CSRs), which allow insurers
    to offer lower-cost individual market plans with lower out-of-pocket costs to
    low-income consumers. If these payments are discontinued, experts predict, it
    could collapse the individual insurance market and dissuade insurers from offering
    plans in the individual marketplace. \n\nThe administration could also stop the
    enforcement of the ACA individual mandate, a provision that ensures younger and
    healthier people buy insurance. Without this provision, insurance companies would
    be forced to consider major premium increases, affecting the affordability of
    insurance for the sick and elderly. Trump issued an executive order discouraging
    IRS enforcement of this mandate, and the Republican-controlled House Appropriations
    Committee has included a draft provision in a spending bill to defund the IRS's
    mandate enforcement. \n\nInsurance experts and the Congressional Budget Office
    have all stated that the ACA is stable and not in a so-called death spiral. However,
    the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress now appear committed to creating
    instability for political gain, creating turmoil in the national insurance market
    and putting the lives of millions of Americans at risk."

    Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

    [IF HHS]: I'm calling to express my serious concern about Trump's intention to let Obamacare fail and put the lives of millions of Americans at risk. I urge Secretary Price to continue cost-sharing reduction payments and enforcement of the individual mandate in order to maintain stability in our national insurance market. The American people want to see the insurance market fixed, not sabotaged for political gain.

    [IF REP or SEN]: I'm calling to express my serious concern about Trump's intention to let Obamacare fail and put the lives of millions of Americans at risk. I urge [REP/SEN NAME] to immediately pass legislation to stabilize the insurance market and ensure the ACA's cost-sharing subsidies are fully funded. The American people want to see the insurance market fixed, not sabotaged for political gain.

    Thank you for your hard work answering the phones.
