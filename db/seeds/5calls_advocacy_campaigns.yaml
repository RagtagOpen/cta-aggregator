  :title: 'Support the College for All Act   '
  :description: "Thanks to skyrocketing college tuition costs, student debt in the
    US amounts to $1.3 trillion. Eighty-three percent of all students attending US
    public universities graduate with debt, and some of them will remain in debt for
    their entire lives. \n\nA coalition of Representatives and Senators have introduced
    a bill to end the crushing burden of high college tuition. The College for All
    Act would provide free public university tuition for families earning up to $125,000
    per year, covering about 80% of all US college students. The bill would also reduce
    student loan interest rates for new borrowers, allow existing borrowers to refinance
    at lower rates, and eliminate tuitions and fees at two-year community colleges.
    \n\nStudent loan debt prevents people from buying homes, starting families, saving
    for retirement, and working in lower-paying but crucial fields like social work
    and early childhood education. It is time to end the student debt crisis and make
    an affordable college education a reality for all.     "

  :title: Defend Title IX Guidelines for Campus Sexual Assault
  :description: |-
    In mid-July, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced that she is considering changes to how the Department of Education enforces Title IX ("9") with respect to campus sexual assault, specifically the 2011 guidelines for how colleges and universities respond to allegations of sexual violence between students on and off campus.These guidelines, outlined in a Dear Colleague Letter (DCL), defines schools’ responsibilities in building a safe and responsive campus, clarifies the requirement that schools must independently investigate reports of sexual violence between students (regardless of the existence of a criminal investigation), and defines “preponderance of the evidence” as the burden of proof necessary when adjudicating sexual assault cases on campus.

    Since 2011, many universities have overhauled their programs for reporting and investigating sexual assault, educating campuses on sex discrimination and providing support for victims of sexual violence. A rushed roll-back of these rules by the administration would send a terrible message to students and administrators and would undermine the protections universities, students and activists have worked so hard to implement.

    Underlining concerns that this administration is ill-equipped to handle sexual assault policy, Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Department's Civil Rights Division Candice Jackson stated to the New York Times that 90% of sexual assault accusations “fall into the category of ‘we were both drunk,’ ‘we broke up.” While Asst. Secretary Jackson has apologized for these remarks, they indicate a department that does not take sexual assault seriously, and call into question her ability to fairly evaluate and manage the Department’s policies around this sensitive and critical issue.

    Twenty state Attorney Generals have already written to Secretary DeVos strongly opposing any roll-back of the Title IX protections and expressing concerns about the continuing role of Assistant Secretary Jackson. These AG's were from: CA, CT, DE, DC, HI, IL, IA, KY, ME, MD, MA, MN, NM, NY, NC, OR, PA, RI, VT, VA.

    Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m an American from [CITY, STATE].

    [IF DEPT of ED] I’m calling to urge Secretary DeVos to maintain the critical Title IX protections for survivors of campus sexual assault as guided by the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter. This is a serious and troubling epidemic, and it is vital that schools maintain strong policy guidelines to protect its vulnerable students.

    [IF CALLING FROM  CA, CT, DE, DC, HI, IL, IA, KY, ME, MD, MA, MN, NM, NY, NC, OR, PA, RI, VT, VA] I'm calling to thank the Attorney General for signing the letter opposing any rollback of Title 9 college campus sexual assault protections by the Department of Education, and I encourage the Attorney General to keep fighting against this serious and troubling epidemic.

    [ALL OTHER STATES] I'm calling to urge [AG NAME] to join with other state Attorneys General in opposing any rollback of the Title 9 college campus sexual assault protections by the Department of Education. This is a serious and troubling epidemic, and it is vital that schools maintain strong policy guidelines to protect its vulnerable students.

    Thank you for your time and attention.

  :title: Preserve Federal Civil Rights Protections for Transgender People
  :description: "Nine Republican House Representatives are currently sponsoring HR
    2796, the Civil Rights Uniformity Act. This hateful bill would exclude transgender
    people from federal civil rights protections against gender discrimination. The
    bill specifically bans gender identity from being \"treated as a protected class
    in Federal law or policy\" without congressional approval, meaning that only Congress
    would be able to pass laws protecting trans rights. \n\nWhile this bill is likely
    just a political stunt that will never make it out of committee, its consequences
    could still be deadly. There is an established correlation between passage of
    bigoted policies like this one and increased rates of suicide in the transgender
    community. Hate-based law making fuels anti-trans attitudes at the highest levels
    of our government and sends a message to trans people that their rights and their
    lives are unimportant. Transgender people face significant discrimination and
    violence because of their gender identity, with over a quarter of trans people
    reporting being fired because of bias and half reporting harassment at work. Trans
    people of color also face even higher rates of discrimination than white transgender
    people. \n\nEroding transgender people's rights at a federal level would endanger
    both their financial and psychological well-being. This latest assault on transgender
    people is despicable and unacceptable. We must make it abundantly clear that Americans
    will not tolerate these blatant attacks on transgender people's civil rights. "
  :template: "Hi, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].   \n\n[IF
    COMMITTEE]: I'd like to pass along a message for the Chairman and committee members.
    I ask that the committee not take any action on HR 2796, the Civil Rights Uniformity
    Act. This bill is an unacceptable, bigoted attack on transgender people and their
    rights.\n\n[IF REP]: I am calling to express my strongest opposition to HR 2796,
    the Civil Rights Uniformity Act, a bigoted attack on transgender people. I ask
    that [REP/SEN NAME] vocally denounce HR 2796 as an unacceptable assault on transgender
    people's rights.\n\n[IF LEAVING A VOICEMAIL: please leave your full street address
