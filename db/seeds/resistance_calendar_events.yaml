    The House and Senate are out of session for the entire month of August, so we think our Members of Congress (Sen. Tom Cotton, Sen. John Boozman, & Rep. Rick Crawford) should hold a Town Hall for their Northeast AR constituents.

    The Earl Bell Community Center has been kind enough to let us use their gymnasium for two dates:

    Tuesday August 8th from 11am-2pm
    Wednesday Aug 23rd from 11am-2pm

    Two dates have been reserved to give our MoC more options as well as less reason for them not to come.

    Crawford, Cotton, and Boozman have been notified and invited, but still have not committed. That being said, it will be up to their constituents to call their offices and DEMAND them to commit. Calling only takes a couple of minutes and produces results. Their numbers:

    Rep. Rick Crawford
    DC- (202) 225-4076
    Jonesboro- (870) 203-0540

    Sen. Tom Cotton
    DC- (202) 224-2353
    Jonesboro- (870) 933-6223

    Sen. John Boozman
    DC- (202) 224-4843
    Jonesboro- (870) 268-6925

    It's up to us to make this happen, so please call their offices and demand them to commit to an August Town Hall in Northeast Arkansas.

    The Congressman's staff regularly hold office hours at rotating Sacramento Public Libraries (SPL) throught his district.

    This event is at the SPL - Elk Grove Branch

    They specify they are there to "help Veterans with backlogged benefits, assist seniors with Social Security and Medicare, stalled passports and more."

    These office hours are always a great opportunity to meet staff and develop a dialogue with your Congressmans' staff. While they cannot always speak on positions, they can pass along concerns and share stories with the Congressman.

    powerful, tender story of race and identity by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the award-winning
    author of Half of a Yellow Sun.\n\nIfemelu and Obinze are young and in love when
    they depart military-ruled Nigeria for the West. Beautiful, self-assured Ifemelu
    heads for America, where despite her academic success, she is forced to grapple
    with what it means to be black for the first time. Quiet, thoughtful Obinze had
    hoped to join her, but with post-9/11 America closed to him, he instead plunges
    into a dangerous, undocumented life in London. Fifteen years later, they reunite
    in a newly democratic Nigeria, and reignite their passion—for each other and for
    their homeland. \n\nThis is one of several interventions to invigorate our YWCA
    mission of Eliminating Racism, Empowering Women and promoting Peace, Justice,
    Freedom and Dignity for All.\nThis book club is an invitation for the community
    to engage in a dialogue on the racism in our world and in our community. We hope,
    through reading this book and others, that the Race to Justice Book Club will
    serve as a space for these conversations to begin and flourish within the YWCA
    community.\n\n\fJoin us in person on Wednesday the 9th at 7:30AM or on line at

  description: "This is it! Despite all the shenanigans and delays, a vote on full
    divestment from fossil fuels has arrived! We have confirmation that the item is
    calendared for August 9th.\n\nThanks to tons of solid work over the last four
    years, a bunch of milestones along the way, and dogged re-engagement the last
    few months, San Francisco's $20 billion pension fund could go fossil-free. \n\nWe
    need EVERYONE at the meeting to build maximum pressure on the Board and drive
    home the message that the public cares about this issue and hasn't given up. If
    you've been planning to take a couple hours off work to resist sometime, this
    is a good time to do so. Getting a final vote on our ultimate goal is very exciting,
    but if it goes down, that's it for full divestment for at least a few years! So
    we need to rise to the occasion. \n\n***If you CANNOT attend (or just want to
    send a letter in addition to attending), please send a comment by email to norm.nickens@sfgov.org.
    Address your comments to the Retirement Board, identify if you are a member of
    the pension system, and make clear you are in favor of full divestment from fossil
    fuels!***\n\nWe're so close to winning a fossil free San Francisco. It's go time.
    Let's do this, team!"

    It never stopped, and now it’s getting worse. Anti-abortion protestors, emboldened by the election, are stepping up their aggressive behavior outside providers’ facilities in NYC and nationwide. Just last week the NY State Attorney General filed a federal lawsuit against protestors who have been harassing patients, staff and volunteers at Choices Women’s Medical Center in Jamaica, Queens.

    Activists have fought against this type of harassment and intimidation in the past. Join us for a discussion and training about what this organizing looked like, and how it can inform clinic defense and escorting today. We’ll explore how NYC activists and volunteers have put their bodies on the line to help keep clinic doors open and to support women seeking to access reproductive health care — including abortion — without shame or interference.

    History and training will be held at Verso Books on the 10th floor. We'll have signs up pointing your way.

    Open and no RSVP needed for access!
