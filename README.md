# CTA Aggregator

The CTA Aggregator is a project to provide a platform-neutral source of truth for activism action.  Sometimes a CTA (call to action) might be an event at a set location or it might involve contacting a member of congress or local politician.

There are several related projects.
* The API: A main app is a Rails app that facilitates CRUD-ing of calls to action and their related resources.
* [Documentation site](https://github.com/Ragtagteam/cta-aggregator-docs): a small site that shows visitors how to interact with the API.
* [Ruby Gem](https://github.com/Ragtagteam/cta-aggregator-client-ruby): A lightweight gem that will take care of adding the appropriate headers and coercing data into the appropriate JSON structure.
* Web Scrapers: apps that import data from websites and API endpoints.

The goal is for CTA Aggregator to serves as a backend to other sites, permitting them access to a broader range of action data without competing for their clicks, eyeballs, likes, follows, etc.

## Technology

This is an API-only Rails 5 app.  It uses Postgres as the persistent data store.

The API is JSON API spec compliant.  API consumers can make requests without caring about the underlying technology.  Click [here](http://jsonapi.org/) for more information on the JSON API spec.

## Usage

There are three resources that are essential to this API:
* CTA: a call to action
* Contact: each CTA has one
* Location: a CTA will have a location if it's an `onsite` CTA

## Setup (native)

* Install PostgreSQL
* Install Ruby (Consult `Gemfile` for version)
* Clone this repo
* Run `bin/setup` (This will install dependencies, create db's, etc.)
* Run test suite: `rake` (To ensure the app is in a good state)
* Start server: `rails s`

The setup script will create a `.env` file, which can be used to manage environment variables.  The `.env` file is ignored by git.  Although the script will copy the `.env.sample` file, the sample file contains no sensitive data (e.g. login credentials).  If codebase requires sensitive information for local development, then contact a contributor to get you set access to those additional environment variables.

## Setup (Docker)

Install [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) for your platform.

    docker-compose run web bin/setup
    docker-compose run web rake
    docker-compose up

Open http://localhost:3000

## Tests

This app uses Rspec and Cucumber for unit and integration tests.

Cucumber tests are written from point of view of an API client.  They're a good example of how you'll need to structure requests to the API.
